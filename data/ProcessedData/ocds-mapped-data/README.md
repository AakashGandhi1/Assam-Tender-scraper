### Uses of the data

E-procurement system such as the GEPNIC ([Government eProcurement System of NIC-GePNIC](https://gepnic.gov.in/)) digitizes all or part of the procurement process, for example, buyers publishing tenders, potential suppliers submitting bids and buyers evaluating bids and awarding contracts. All of these activities result in the creation of data, typically stored in the database of the e-procurement system.
OCDS describes how to disclose that information as open data in a standardised structure and format.
Disclosing contracting data using OCDS, encourages the development of reusable tools and methodologies based on OCDS data.

Through Open Contracting Partnership (OCP) designing the Open Contracting Data Standard and working with stakeholders around the globe on procurement reforms, we have identified five key use cases related to procurement data:

- Market opportunities
- Value for money
- Public Integrity
- Service delivery
- Internal efficiency

CDL worked with the Finance Department, Government of Assam to open more than 45,000 tenders awarded by the state (Financial Years 2016-17 to 2022-23) and partnered with OCP to publish the data according to the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS).

With our collaboration with the Government of Assam and the Assam State Disaster Management Authority, CivicDataLab has been working towards building solutions to better protect vulnerable communities from extreme weather events through implementing open contracting strategies for better flood-related procurement.

This model was made possible through CDL collaboration with the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) to combine procurement data with dozens of other datasets, as well as working with Assam’s Finance Department to structure and standardize data on all flood-related procurement from the last five years.
